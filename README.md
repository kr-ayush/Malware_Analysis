# Malware_Analysis
Malware Dataset are Taken from kaggle and different ML Algorithms are implemented to get the accuracy and we can change the parameter to find the best accuray before the model goes overfitting.
Decision Tree has been my primary Classification Algorithm but the same can be done with different algorithm such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Regression, SVM.
The major part is understanding how different parameter in the classification funtion of sklearn library might affect the accuray.
